# REVA University Conversational AI

This project is a dedicated Conversational AI system built for REVA University to provide essential information to students, faculty, and visitors. It leverages advanced AI models for natural language processing, speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and trained models for university-specific purposes. The interface is designed using Python, HTML, JavaScript, and integrates a purpose-trained AI model.

## Features
- **General University Information**: Details about REVA University, courses offered, campus facilities, and departments.
- **Personalized Assistance**: Customized responses for students based on their queries, such as academic schedules, exam timetables, and event updates.
- **Interactive Interface**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities for a fully interactive user experience.
- **Real-time Query Handling**: Quick responses to FAQs like "How to access the library?", "Placement opportunities?", etc.
- **Multilingual Support**: Responses in English and Kannada for user convenience.

## Technologies Used
### Backend:
- **Python**: For server-side logic and integration of AI models.
- **Trained AI Model**: A specialized model trained on REVA University's data for accurate and specific responses.
- **Flask Framework**: For setting up RESTful API endpoints.

### Frontend:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building an interactive and user-friendly interface.

### AI Integration:
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Converts voice queries into text for AI processing.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts textual responses into audio for user playback.
- **Custom AI Model**: Trained using university-specific datasets.

## How It Works
1. **User Query**: Users can type or speak their query into the interface.
2. **STT/TTS Processing**: Voice queries are converted to text using STT, and the response is synthesized back into speech using TTS.
3. **AI Model**: The trained AI model processes the query and generates an appropriate response.
4. **Response Delivery**: The response is displayed in the UI and optionally played back via TTS.
